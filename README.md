Apple TV 2
==========

Some stuff fore my Apple TV 2 ( ATV2 )

### restart_without_reboot.sh
Restarts Apple TV without rebooting.

### crond.sh
Crond like shell script. Takes two arguments: time and command, for example if you want to run the "ls" command at 12:04, run:
```crond.sh 12:04 ls```

### advancedsettings.xml
Increases buffer size. Helps if XBMC keeps crashing when playing movies.
